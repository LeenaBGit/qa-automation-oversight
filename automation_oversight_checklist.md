#  Test Automation Oversight Checklist

This checklist helps QA Leads and Strategists ensure automation efforts are aligned with product goals, maintainable, and delivering ROI. It's ideal for overseeing automation work done by developers or dedicated QA engineers.

##  Strategy-Level Oversight

- [ ] Are the **right test cases** chosen for automation (repeatable, stable, high-value)?
- [ ] Is there a balance between **UI, API, and backend automation**?
- [ ] Is the automation effort aligned with **release goals** and not over-engineered?
- [ ] Are flaky tests regularly reviewed and removed from CI pipelines?

---

##  Technical Process Oversight

- [ ] Is there a working **CI/CD setup** (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)?
- [ ] Are failed tests investigated daily?
- [ ] Are proper **wait strategies**, locators, and data mocks used?
- [ ] Is the test data dynamic and environment-safe?

##  Maintenance & Reporting

- [ ] Are test scripts modular and maintainable?
- [ ] Is there documentation on how to run/update tests?
- [ ] Are reports accessible to the team (Allure, HTML, or CI dashboards)?
- [ ] Are test case priorities updated as the app evolves?
